# InformationLiteracy

1. There are two sheet in 'Experimental Parameters.xlsx'. sheet 1 includes all experimental parameters from file 'Part1' to 'Part4', sheet 2 includes all the visualizaion points from file 'Part1' to 'Part4'.

2. There are two structure figure to constructe Monte Carlo simulation in '信息层MC演化图.pdf' & '疫情层MC演化.pdf'.

3. 'Part1' includes MMCA simulation codes and results of five experiments, 'Part1-vis' includes corresponding visualizaion code and figures.

4. 'Part2' includes MMCA simulation codes and results of the 4th experiment with information literacy parameter \theta re-designed to follow a power-law distribution with exponent 2, 'Part2-vis' includes corresponding visualizaion code and figures.

5. 'Part3' includes Monte Carlo simulation codes and results of five experiments, 'Part3-vis' includes corresponding visualizaion code and figures.

6. 'Part4' includes Monte Carlo simulation codes and results of the 4th experiment with information literacy parameter \theta re-designed to follow a power-law distribution with exponent 2, 'Part3-vis' includes corresponding visualizaion code and figures.

7. 'structure-vis' file includes the visualization code of multiplex network.
